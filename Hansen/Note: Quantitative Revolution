abstract = {RÉSUMÉ Au cours des dix dernières années, un phénomène qu'on pourrait appeler “révolution quantitative” a transformé radicalement esprit et objet de la géographie. Initiée par des physiciens et des mathématiciens, cette révolution n'a pas changé que la géographie, mais les autres sciences également. auteur décrit influence de cette révolution quantitative sur la géographie et ses rapports avec le déterminisme. Il est avis que ces transformations résultent un besoin élaborer des théories scientifiques. Les recherches géographiques feront de plus en plus usage des méthodes mathématiques et on accordera une plus large place à la construction et à application expérimentale de modèles théoriques. Ceci n'obviera pas au besoin études idéographiques, mais ces dernières pourront ětre étayées par des énoncés théoriques.},

## Questions 

### What is the article *about*?

The general characterisrics of the quantitative movement, the coming of the quantitative revolution to geography, and how it assess the value of quantitative techniques in the development of theory.

### What kind of contribution is the paper trying to make?^[Is it conceptual, theoretical, empirical, or something else?]

The development, importance, and needs of the quantitative techniques in geography that impact greatly to geographers. 


### What gap(s) does it identify/tackle?^[If there is a clear 'gap' identified, great, but what other literature(s) mentioned? Meaning, do they lay out or contrast different 'groups' of related articles]

1. Hesitance whether mathematical formulae and statistical analysis might not give a false impression of objectivity and accuracy in geography
2. Few geomorphic topics provide data suited directly to statistical treatment


### What is/are the main research questions(s)/argument(s)?^[What ideas are going to be tackled?]


### How are they explored/presented?^[How do they say they will test and/or make use of these ideas as part of their research?]

Points that are presented in the article:

1. Quantification in geography as indeterministic (p.152)
2. In the level of scientific knowing, it is necessary to establish generic concepts that can be applied obejctively and accurately (p.152-153)
3. Quantitative revolution is over. An intellectual revolution is over when accepted ideas have been overthrown or have been modified to include new ideas. An intellectual revolution is over when the revolutionary ideas themselves become a part of the conventional wisdom. 
4. Given the need to comply with the rigorous dictates of the scientific method, the need to develop theory, and to test theory with prediction, then mathematics is the best tool available to us for the purpose
5. Testing of hypotheses does not make much sense unless these hypotheses are related to a developing body of theory. 
6. The use of quantitative techniques demostrates rigour to the extent that precise measurements of association are made. Avoid self-deception

 

### How are data used to test them?^[Where does the data come from, and how well do they explain what it contains? Is it biased or limited in any way?]

Using literature references. 


### What are the main findings?^[Just the highlights!]


### What is the contribution?

Explaining the importance of both quantitative techniques and theoritical in geography. The development and testing of theory is the only way to obtain new and verifiable knowledge and new and verifiable understandings. In an increasing number of cases, the relationship to theory can best be shown in quantitative terms. 

## Discuss!

## What am I still confused about?

To what extent the development of a new theory in geography will not have a relationship at all to quantitative? Or in these era, all new theory should be supported by the quantitative approaches at hand. 

## Based on the above, why was I encouraged to read this?

This is very interesting article that's shown the balancing desription and explanation between quantitative and theoritical approaches in geography. The knowledge is developed over time. Changing from those that don't even touch or involve on quantitative analysis to those that are part of the curriculum. It will be very intriguing to understand how the two relate to one another as theory and technology advance.
