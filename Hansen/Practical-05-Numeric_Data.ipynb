    "After a few weeks getting to grips with Python, we're now going to start working with some real data. One of the first things that we do when working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There are a _huge_ number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size was, etc.)\n",
    "2. Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column specs, etc.)\n",
    "3. Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels\n",
    "4. Producing descriptive statistics\n",
    "5. Visualising the data using plots\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use _all_ of these together to really understand where the data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other problems. If you're wondering which comes first, the concept of _start with a chart_ is always good... though we've obviously not _quite_ gotten there yet! This week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself, so although we will do some plotting of charts, we'll focus on 3-4 with a tiny bit of 5. There will be much more on plotting charts next week, and you should be looking into 1 and 2 yourself based on what's been written both on the [Inside Airbnb web site](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) and in the [suggested readings](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/bib/Bibliography.md).\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas can do a *lot*, and you might be feeling a little intimidated by this, but here's the thing: we were already writing something like pandas from scratch! That's because pandas takes a **column-view of data** in the same way that our **Dictionary-of-Lists** did, it's just that it's got a lot more features than our 'simple' tool did. That's why the documentation is so much more forbidding and why pandas is so much more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at its heart, a pandas `Data Frame` (`df` for short) is a collection of `Data Series` objects (i.e. columns) with an index. Each Series is like one of our column-lists from the last notebook. And the `df` is like the dictionary that held the data together. So you've seen this before and you already _know_ what's going on... or at least you now have an _analogy_ that you can use to make sense of pandas:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myDataFrame = {\n",
    "    '<column_name_1>': <Series_1>,\n",
    "    '<column_name_2>': <Series_2>,\n",
    "    '<column_name_3>': <Series_3>\n",
    "}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "And pandas gives us two ways to access that data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a method syntax: `myDataFrame.column_name_1`\n",
    "2. Using a dictionary syntax: `myDataFrame['column_name_1']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which syntax you prefer, you can use these interchangeably. The only times you *have* to choose one over the other are: a) assignment (e.g. `myDataFrame['column_name_1'] = ...`); b) columns with spaces in their names (e.g. `myDataFrame['Column Name 1')`)."

    "You will need to do several things here to read the remote, compressed CSV file specified by `url` into a data frame called `df`. Setting `low_memory=False` ensures that pandas will try to load the entire data set _before_ guessing the data format! Obviously, with very large files this is probably a bad idea and it's possible to force a particular column type while readng in the data as well. For larger data sets there are platforms like [Dask](https://dask.org/) (see, eg, [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-and-how-to-use-dask-with-big-data-746e34dac7c3)), and beyond that are [other options](https://towardsdatascience.com/scaling-pandas-comparing-dask-ray-modin-vaex-and-rapids-c74c85a4e59c)."

    "   - Check the code to fix data types and (where relevant) values works.\n",
    "   - Write this new, smaller file ($m` << m$ and $n` << n$) out to a `data/clean` or `data/canonical` directory (depending on whether formatting the columns is so complex or takes so long on a large data set that it needs to be separated out from actual cleaning).\n",

    "Notice that the row with index value `9104` is clearly _wrong_: if I had to guess, I'd say that it's some kind of partial extract/write process because there _are_ elements in there that look right but they are in the wrong columns. So we can _probably_ drop some of these rows, but one thing to do is look at the frequency of NaNs across the data frame _first_. So we need to look for NaNs and Nulls, but it's quite obvious that a `NaN` in the listing id is a basic problem and we should [drop these](https://chrisalbon.com/python/data_wrangling/pandas_dropping_column_and_rows/)."

    "I've found dates to be particularly challenging, though pandas has _tried_ to make this process less painful than before using the `infer_datetime_format` option. What can be particularly frustrating is if a row has a non-sensical date value (e.g. `t`, as happened in 2019/20 when I taught this module) in _one_ of the datetime columns and this causes the type conversion to fail. When that happens, pandas is not always great about communicating where a problem occurred and I eventually worked it out by trying to convert _parts_ of each series in the data frame to a datetime until I had a block that failed. I then knew that I could narrow this down using integer location indexing."

    "Kind of handy, no? These aren't the _best_ looking plots, but they are all being generated on-the-fly for you by pandas with no more than a cheery `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>`! Since those plots are all just method calls, many of them take optional parameters to change the colour, the notation (scientific or not), and other options. For example, many of the documentation pages linked to above are rather brief, but include a link to [the general options that can be applied to all `Series.plot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.html) calls.\n",
